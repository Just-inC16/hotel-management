# üè® Hotel Booking Microservices Application

This project is a **Hotel Management System** built using a **microservices architecture**. It consists of **7 independent services** that communicate through REST APIs, registered under a **Eureka Server** and accessed via an **API Gateway**.

The application demonstrates **service discovery**, **load balancing**, **fault tolerance (circuit breaker)**, and **database management** ‚Äî providing a real-world example of scalable, cloud-ready design (deployable on AWS).

## üöÄ Features

- **Customer Service** ‚Äì Manages customer registration, authentication, and profiles  
- **Hotel Management Service** ‚Äì Handles hotel details, room availability, and pricing  
- **Reservation Service** ‚Äì Allows customers to reserve available rooms  
- **Payment Service** ‚Äì Processes and validates customer payments  
- **Notification Service** ‚Äì Sends notifications after successful payments  
- **API Gateway** ‚Äì Routes external requests to internal microservices securely  
- **Eureka Server** ‚Äì Provides service discovery for all registered microservices

## üí° Example Flow

**Scenario:** A customer books a hotel room.

1. The client (frontend) sends a request to **API Gateway** ‚Üí `/api/reservations/create`
2. The **API Gateway** routes the request to **Reservation Service**
3. **Reservation Service**:
   - Calls **Hotel Management Service** to verify room availability  
   - Calls **Customer Service** to fetch customer details  
   - Creates a reservation record in its database
4. **Reservation Service** calls **Payment Service** to handle payment  
5. **Payment Service**:
   - Processes the payment  
   - Sends confirmation to **Notification Service**
6. **Notification Service** sends an email/SMS to the customer confirming the booking  

‚úÖ If any service fails, the **Circuit Breaker** triggers fallback logic (e.g., retry or return cached data).
